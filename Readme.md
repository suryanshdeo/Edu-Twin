# 🎓 EduTwin: LLM-Powered Digital Twin of University Students

## 🚀 Overview

EduTwin is an AI-powered system that creates a **Digital Twin of a student** using a dynamic **Live Learner Profile (LLP)** built from real user data.
It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate student behavior, diagnose weaknesses, predict performance, and generate personalized learning content.

---

## 💡 Problem Statement

Most education systems treat students uniformly despite differences in:

* Learning pace
* Background knowledge
* Study habits
* Cognitive preferences

EduTwin addresses this by building a **personalized AI twin for each student**, enabling adaptive and intelligent learning.

## 🧠 Key Features

### 🔐 Authentication System

* Secure **login/signup**
* Password hashing and session handling

### 🗄️ Database-Driven Profiles

* Stores real student data (no synthetic data)
* Persistent and updatable learner profiles

### 📊 Live Learner Profile (LLP)

* Dynamic representation of student state
* Includes academic, behavioral, and self-reported data

### 🔍 Weakness Diagnosis

* Identifies weak topics using LLM reasoning

### 📘 Personalized Explanations

* Tailored explanations based on student profile

### 📈 Performance Prediction

* Predicts future performance (High / Medium / Low)

### 📝 Exam Answer Simulation

* Simulates how a student would answer exam questions

     * Study habits
     * Confidence levels

3. **Database Storage**

   * Data stored and managed via CRUD operations

4. **LLP Generation**

   * Profile Builder creates structured learner profile

5. **LLM Twin Engine**

   * Uses LLP for:

     * Weakness detection
     * Explanation generation
     * Prediction
     * Simulation

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone Repository

```bash id="v0bch8"
git clone https://github.com/suryanshdeo/Edu-Twin.git
cd EduTwin
```

---

### 2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment

```bash id="uv6v0z"
python -m venv venv
```

Activate:

* Windows:

```bash id="0jhv02"
venv\Scripts\activate
```

* Mac/Linux:

```bash id="vt4q8z"
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash id="17lq6d"
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4️⃣ Setup Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```id="l9ehts"
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

The app loads this `.env` automatically at startup.  
For cloud deployments, set `GROQ_API_KEY` in the platform's environment-variable settings.

---

### 5️⃣ Run the Application

```bash id="3gpytr"
streamlit run ui/app.py
```

---

* Generate learner profile
* Use:

  * Weakness diagnosis
  * Topic explanation
  * Performance prediction
  * Exam simulation

---

### Teacher Flow 

* View all students
* Analyze class trends
* Identify weak learners
